   - Define models for entities like members, blogs, and news.
   - Define controllers for each API Section
   - Implement route for each section API

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Standardize error responses with proper status codes and error messages.

6. **Testing**:
   - Write unit and integration tests using frameworks like Mocha, Jest, or Supertest.

7. **Linting and Formatting**:
   - Enforce coding standards with ESLint and Prettier.

8. **Deployment**:
